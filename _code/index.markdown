I am a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at [Perception and Interaction Lab](https://pilab.unige.it) in the [DIBRIS](https://dibris.unige.it/en) department of the [University of Genoa](https://unige.it/en) specializing in Extended Reality (XR). This is my [University Profile](https://rubrica.unige.it/personale/UUBEWF9r).

## Research interests


My research focuses on:

- Design, development and evaluation of Extended Reality (XR) applications 
- Immersive visualization technologies
- Human–computer interaction and user-centered design
- Applications of XR in motor rehabilitation and education

## About me
With a background in bioengineering and a passion for immersive technologies, I focus on the design, development, and evaluation of XR applications. My research spans human–computer interaction, immersive visualization, and interactive technologies, with a particular interest in their applications for motor rehabilitation and education.

Beyond my research activities, I am actively engaged in the XR community. I am part of the organizing committee of [XRehab](https://sites.google.com/view/xrehab/home)
, a workshop within IEEE ISMAR 2025 dedicated to XR for rehabilitation. I am also a member of the [DoCS
group](https://docs-dibris.github.io) an association of PhD students in Computer Science that promotes seminars and other initiatives to foster collaboration and exchange of ideas among doctoral candidates. Within this context, I helped organize two editions of the [Computer Science Workshop 2023](https://docs-dibris.github.io/docs/Computer%20Science%20Workshop/csw23.html)
and [Computer Science Workshop 2024](https://docs-dibris.github.io/docs/Computer%20Science%20Workshop/csw24.html).
The CSW is a unique event fully organized by PhD students, aiming to provide peers from different areas of computer science with a broader perspective on the discipline. Each year, the workshop hosts high-profile academic speakers from diverse subfields of computer science, both Italian and international, and includes contributions from local companies to showcase industry perspectives and research opportunities.  

Currently, I also serve as PhD students’ representative within the DIBRIS department, an experience that has strengthened my organizational and coordination skills while fostering collaboration across disciplines.
