    "content": "With a background in bioengineering and a passion for immersive technologies, I focus on the design, development, and evaluation of XR applications. My research spans human–computer interaction, immersive visualization, and interactive technologies, with a particular interest in their applications for motor rehabilitation and education. Beyond my research activities, I am actively engaged in the XR community. I am part of the organizing committee of XRehab , a workshop within IEEE ISMAR 2025 dedicated to XR for rehabilitation. I am also a member of the DoCS group an association of PhD students in Computer Science that promotes seminars and other initiatives to foster collaboration and exchange of ideas among doctoral candidates. Within this context, I helped organize two editions of the Computer Science Workshop 2023 and Computer Science Workshop 2024. The CSW is a unique event fully organized by PhD students, aiming to provide peers from different areas of computer science with a broader perspective on the discipline. Each year, the workshop hosts high-profile academic speakers from diverse subfields of computer science, both Italian and international, and includes contributions from local companies to showcase industry perspectives and research opportunities. Currently, I also serve as PhD students’ representative within the DIBRIS department, an experience that has strengthened my organizational and coordination skills while fostering collaboration across disciplines.
